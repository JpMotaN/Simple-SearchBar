Simple Search Bar

A lightweight, system-agnostic module that adds a powerful global search bar to Foundry VTT.

With a single shortcut (default Ctrl/Cmd+K) or a draggable floating button, you can instantly search across your world and compendia:

🔍 Search everything – Actors, Items, Journal Entries, Roll Tables, and compendium content.

🧙 Character integration – Finds spells or items inside player/actor sheets; can open them directly or cast them (if supported by the system, e.g., D&D5e).

🎲 Drag-and-drop – Quickly drag tokens from search results (actors from world or compendia) directly onto the scene.

⌨️ Keyboard navigation – Arrow keys and Enter to move through and select results.

🖱️ Configurable controls – Fully integrated with Configure Controls so you can change the hotkey.

📐 Resizable & persistent window – The search panel can be resized, repositioned, and remembers its state between sessions.

🎛️ Optional floating button (FAB) – Drag to reposition; acts as a quick-access search launcher.

🌐 Internationalization – Currently supports English and Brazilian Portuguese.

👉 In short: Simple Search Bar is the fastest way to find and use anything in your Foundry world or compendia.
